# Hi, I'm Vincent 👋🏻 
---
I'm a **Freshman Computer Science Student** 📚, Aspiring *Data Scientist* 📊 and *Web Developer* 🖥️. I want to make data beautiful, simple, accessable to all, and a force for positive change in the world. 

I started my software journey in middle school writing simple python scripts, some of which are still up on this Github. During high school I participated in the [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc), where I learned about OOP, Java, and building software with a deadline. Today, I'm studying **C++ and Data Structures** at *University of Houston*. My interest in Web Development started with the [Katy Youth Hacks](https://katyhacks.org/) hackathon, where my team built [Food Oasis](https://devpost.com/software/food-oasis-irp89a) to help people who live in [food deserts](https://foodispower.org/access-health/food-deserts/). I became interested in data science when competing in the [Rice Datathon](https://datathon.rice.edu/)
, where my team built [Miles to Victory](https://devpost.com/software/miles-to-victory-travel-s-impact-on-mlb-performance?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects).  When I'm not coding, you can find me riding my bike 🚲, reading 📖, or playing cello 🎻.

 - 🏗️I'm currently working on my [Personal Website](https://github.com/WrenVin/PersonalWebsite)
 - 🌱I'm currently learning [data structures](https://neetcode.io/courses/dsa-for-beginners/0)
